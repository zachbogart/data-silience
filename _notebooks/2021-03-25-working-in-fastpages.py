# ## Hello, World!

# Well that was relatively painless.
#
# Here's a site made out of (mostly) jupyter notebooks. This post is just a jupyter notebook. ðŸ˜Ž Thanks, [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)! ðŸš€

# ## What Was Easy

# - **Setup is a breeze**: fastpages made it really easy to setup from their repo. Using an auto-generated pull request, was able to get a new repo up and running with no trouble.
# - **Connect to existing stuff**: Connecting to GitHub Pages site [zachbogart.github.io](https://zachbogart.github.io/) was easy. Just set it as the `baseurl`.
# - **Tracking Notebooks**: Was worried that the use of jupyter notebooks to render the posts might mean that the `.ipynb` files have to be git tracked. This can be a pain cause there is a lot in each notebook, so running a notebook without changing code will still lead to git changes, which are difficult to parse without additional tools. 
#     - However, at least for this post, [jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) works like a charm!{% fn 1 %} Can work in jupyter notebooks, track python script versions of them, and have it all be rendered to a site. Super awesome. Hope it lasts...

# ## What Will Require More Understanding
#
# - **Handling Images**: For previous posts, I used images as thumbnails *and* at the start of each post. In my experimenting, was finding I had to copy the image in two places: `my_icons` in the `_notebooks` folder and in the `images` folder. Wondering if there is a cleaner way to include an image in just one place (the [docs](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setting-an-image-for-social-media) mention that the social media image can only be set under `images`).
# - **It's a big machine**: The repo can be pretty intimidating. There are a lot of folders that make it go and a bunch of files with "THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!" penciled in. Will take some getting used to, getting comfortable with the setup and knowing what parts I should touch. There are some files that I could burn myself on, so I will go slow, use oven mitts, and try not to void any warranties.

# I'll keep [the docs](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#welcome-to-fastpages) handy. 
#
# Till next time!

# {{ '[Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) is a super useful way to save off jupyter notebooks as other formats. I use it all the time. Pairing a notebook is easy and you can just set it and forget it. Note: If in [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), use "View > Activate Command Palette" or "Shift + Cmd + C" to "Pair..." a notebook format. Took me a while to find out how to do this! ' | fndetail: 1 }}
