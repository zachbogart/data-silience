## What is this?

This is a place where I code up things. Maybe you'll learn something. I know I will.

## Who are you?

I'm [Zach Bogart](https://zachbogart.com/about/). Hi there! üëã

## You misspelled "Science"

I've probably misspelled other things, but that was intentional.

## Can I give you a coffee?

Sure! I'm more of a tea or hot chocolate kind of guy, but sure! Much appreciated!

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Give me a "coffee" (read as "tea" or "hot chocolate")', '#FE5C62', 'G2G81P6UM');kofiwidget2.draw();</script> 

## Anything else?
