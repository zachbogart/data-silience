            "content": ". I find that I mostly work on getting things to work so I can then do work. . Does that last sentence work? . Basically, most of the time I&#39;m not doing analyses or visualizing something cool. Instead I&#39;m setting up an environment or making sure things are pointing at the right files or whatever. I&#39;m getting things ready a lot, so I wanted to try smooth out some of the hassle of setting things up. . So, I made a little template called vanillin to setup a project quickly, allowing me to work out of Docker and code in Jupyter Notebooks with a few of the sharp edges removed. . . &#128065;&#65039;&#128150;&#128104;&#8205;&#128187;&#128217;&#39;s (I love code notebooks) . To backup, let&#39;s start with &quot;I like coding in notebooks&quot;. . Jupyter notebooks are great. You can see what is happening for every cell. I do most of my work in Jupyter Notebooks with Python. Observable is also super cool, although I&#39;m less familiar with JavaScript, but learning about it will definitely be through that medium. . I like the code notebook. But they require a bit of setup each time. And keeping track of all that can be a pain. Mostly it&#39;s keeping track of Python. . Why&#39;d it have to be snakes . I&#39;ve always been told that working in Python, you have to work out of virtual environments. The annoying thing I&#39;ve found about this is sharing notebooks with other people. Collaborators have their own setup and make their own environments. It is annoying to keep track of. People have made a lot of tools like pipenv and Poetry, or general practices like requirements.txt, but I find it a bit of a hassle because I only want to run a jupyter notebook. After all of the generating and setup, we are working out of a browser in jupyter. It would be nice if when sharing notebooks I wouldn&#39;t have to worry so much about the environment they are run in. I just want a command that builds up an environment and gets me inside the jupyter environment. . In other words, I want to limit the amount of time I worry about my kitchen and instead focus on cooking. . Turns out to do this, you kind of have to think a lot about kitchens first. . Trying to Make it Myself . My first attempt was to make my own kitchen from scratch. I was using Docker to make custom environments for each project. This worked, but it was a hassle, since it was a lot of things to manage. . Had to make custom environments for different use cases and host them on DockerHub | Had to maintain all that stuff | . Rather than making things easier to use, it was just a hassle to handle. I wasn&#39;t very familiar with Docker and I wanted to leave the maintenance to people with more experience. . Turns out Jupyter already had this setup...setup. . Using Jupyter Docker Stacks . Came across the Jupyter Docker Stacks and that made things a lot simpler. They maintain docker images and I can pull the ones I want to run jupyter notebooks. When I&#39;m working out of the images, I can be a lot less worried about installing things. I also can now pass a notebook along with a Dockerfile and know it&#39;ll run for someone. Then we can actually collaborate rather than keep asking questions about how our machines are working. . This setup still is a bit of a hassle. These docker commands are quite intimidating: . docker build --rm -t DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME . docker run --rm -p 10000:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v $PWD:/home/jovyan/work DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME . When I run these, I only ever change the image name and the port. So let&#39;s smooth that out a bit. . Smooth and Creamy . Vanillin is not that fancy. It&#39;s just a blank repo and an ohmyzsh plugin, but makes it much easier to just get cooking quickly. . Dockerfile is taking a base image from the Jupyter Docker Stacks. And I can pick the fanciest kitchen they have for no extra cost. They have a bunch to pick from if size is a big issue. | Additional packages I may need can be installed in the Dockerfile or run in a notebook cell | Command to start things up is similar to jupyter notebook, trying to be as easy to use as possible | . vanillin DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME # build command vanillin DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME 10000 # run notebook on port 10000 . It&#39;s not actually doing much, but I find it much more user-friendly. . A lot of ice cream: The drawback of this setup is the images are big. The fancy kitchen does come at a cost of the size of 1-2 GB. But it handles everything. I think it&#39;s a good tradeoff. . . Mmm...Vanillin . I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll soon find a smoother way to code things up in code notebooks, but right now this setup has been very helpful. . Have smart people handle docker containers/images | Make a Dockerfile that suits the needs of a project | Get going! Start up jupyter easily. Install things without getting goosebumps. Share work with others without a bunch of back and forth (jupytext does help as well). | . Make a mess in the kitchen. Cook up something tasty. . That&#39;s it. Feel free to give vanillin a try. Hope you are doing well. . Till next time! . .

            "content": ". Hello, World! . Well that was relatively painless. . Here&#39;s a site made out of (mostly) jupyter notebooks. This post is just a jupyter notebook. üòé Thanks, fastpages! üöÄ . What Was Easy . Setup is a breeze: fastpages made it really easy to setup from their repo. Using an auto-generated pull request, was able to get a new repo up and running with no trouble. | Connect to existing stuff: Connecting to GitHub Pages site zachbogart.github.io was easy. Just set it as the baseurl. | Tracking Notebooks: Was worried that the use of jupyter notebooks to render the posts might mean that the .ipynb files have to be git tracked. This can be a pain cause there is a lot in each notebook, so running a notebook without changing code will still lead to git changes, which are difficult to parse without additional tools. However, at least for this post, jupytext works like a charm!1 Can work in jupyter notebooks, track python script versions of them, and have it all be rendered to a site. Super awesome. Hope it lasts... | . | . What Will Require More Understanding . Handling Images: For previous posts, I used images as thumbnails and at the start of each post. In my experimenting, was finding I had to copy the image in two places: my_icons in the _notebooks folder and in the images folder. Wondering if there is a cleaner way to include an image in just one place (the docs mention that the social media image can only be set under images). | It&#39;s a big machine: The repo can be pretty intimidating. There are a lot of folders that make it go and a bunch of files with &quot;THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!&quot; penciled in. Will take some getting used to, getting comfortable with the setup and knowing what parts I should touch. There are some files that I could burn myself on, so I will go slow, use oven mitts, and try not to void any warranties. | . I&#39;ll keep the docs handy. . Till next time! . .

Jupytext is a super useful way to save off jupyter notebooks as other formats. I use it all the time. Pairing a notebook is easy and you can just set it and forget it. Note: If in JupyterLab, use &quot;View &gt; Activate Command Palette&quot; or &quot;Shift + Cmd + C&quot; to &quot;Pair...&quot; a notebook format. Took me a while to find out how to do this! ‚Ü© .",
