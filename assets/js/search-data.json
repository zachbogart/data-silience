            "content": ". Hello, World! . Well that was relatively painless. . Here&#39;s a site made out of (mostly) jupyter notebooks. This post is just a jupyter notebook. üòé Thanks, fastpages! üöÄ . What Was Easy . Setup is a breeze: fastpages made it really easy to setup from their repo. Using an auto-generated pull request, was able to get a new repo up and running with no trouble. | Connect to existing stuff: Connecting to GitHub Pages site zachbogart.github.io was easy. Just set it as the baseurl. | Tracking Notebooks: Was worried that the use of jupyter notebooks to render the posts might mean that the .ipynb files have to be git tracked. This can be a pain cause there is a lot in each notebook, so running a notebook without changing code will still lead to git changes, which are difficult to parse without additional tools. However, at least for this post, jupytext works like a charm!1 Can work in jupyter notebooks, track python script versions of them, and have it all be rendered to a site. Super awesome. Hope it lasts... | . | . What Will Require More Understanding . Handling Images: For previous posts, I used images as thumbnails and at the start of each post. In my experimenting, was finding I had to copy the image in two places: my_icons in the _notebooks folder and in the images folder. Wondering if there is a cleaner way to include an image in just one place (the docs mention that the social media image can only be set under images). | It&#39;s a big machine: The repo can be pretty intimidating. There are a lot of folders that make it go and a bunch of files with &quot;THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!&quot; penciled in. Will take some getting used to, getting comfortable with the setup and knowing what parts I should touch. There are some files that I could burn myself on, so I will go slow, use oven mitts, and try not to void any warranties. | . I&#39;ll keep the docs handy. . Till next time! . .

The technician is preparing a data report. This equipment was located at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, LFPL, now John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, Cleveland Ohio. | . | . 1. Jupytext is a super useful way to save off jupyter notebooks as other formats. I use it all the time. Pairing a notebook is easy and you can just set it and forget it. Note: If in JupyterLab, use &quot;View &gt; Activate Command Palette&quot; or &quot;Shift + Cmd + C&quot; to &quot;Pair...&quot; a notebook format. Took me a while to find out how to do this! ‚Ü© .",
