<p>Well that was relatively painless.</p>
<p>Here's a site made out of (mostly) jupyter notebooks. This post is just a jupyter notebook. ðŸ˜Ž Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a>! ðŸš€</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Setup is a breeze</strong>: fastpages made it really easy to setup from their repo. Using an auto-generated pull request, was able to get a new repo up and running with no trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Connect to existing stuff</strong>: Connecting to GitHub Pages site <a href="https://zachbogart.github.io/">zachbogart.github.io</a> was easy. Just set it as the <code>baseurl</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking Notebooks</strong>: Was worried that the use of jupyter notebooks to render the posts might mean that the <code>.ipynb</code> files have to be git tracked. This can be a pain cause there is a lot in each notebook, so running a notebook without changing code will still lead to git changes, which are difficult to parse without additional tools. <ul>
<li>However, at least for this post, <a href="https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">jupytext</a> works like a charm!{% fn 1 %} Can work in jupyter notebooks, track python script versions of them, and have it all be rendered to a site. Super awesome. Hope it lasts...</li>

<li><strong>Handling Images</strong>: For previous posts, I used images as thumbnails <em>and</em> at the start of each post. In my experimenting, was finding I had to copy the image in two places: <code>my_icons</code> in the <code>_notebooks</code> folder and in the <code>images</code> folder. Wondering if there is a cleaner way to include an image in just one place (the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setting-an-image-for-social-media">docs</a> mention that the social media image can only be set under <code>images</code>).</li>
<li><strong>It's a big machine</strong>: The repo can be pretty intimidating. There are a lot of folders that make it go and a bunch of files with "THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!" penciled in. Will take some getting used to, getting comfortable with the setup and knowing what parts I should touch. There are some files that I could burn myself on, so I will go slow, use oven mitts, and try not to void any warranties.</li>

<p>{{ '<a href="https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext">Jupytext</a> is a super useful way to save off jupyter notebooks as other formats. I use it all the time. Pairing a notebook is easy and you can just set it and forget it. Note: If in <a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">JupyterLab</a>, use "View &gt; Activate Command Palette" or "Shift + Cmd + C" to "Pair..." a notebook format. Took me a while to find out how to do this! ' | fndetail: 1 }}</p>
