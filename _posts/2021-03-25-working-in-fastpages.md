<p>Well that was relatively painless. Here's a site made out of (mostly) jupyter notebooks. Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages">fastpages</a>!</p>

<li>fastpages made it really easy to setup from their repo. Using an auto-generated pull request, was able to get a new repo up and running with no trouble.</li>
<li>Connecting to GitHub Pages site <a href="https://zachbogart.github.io/">zachbogart.github.io</a> was easy. Just set it as the <code>baseurl</code>.</li>

<h2 id="What-Will-Require-More-Understanding">What Will Require More Understanding<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-Will-Require-More-Understanding"> </a></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Handling Images</strong>: For previous posts, I used images as thumbnails and at the start of each post. In my experimenting, was finding I had to copy the image in two places: <code>my_icons</code> in the <code>_notebooks</code> folder and in the <code>images</code> folder. Wondering if there is a cleaner way to include an image in just one place (the <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setting-an-image-for-social-media">docs</a> mention that the social media image can only be set under <code>images</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking Notebooks</strong>: The setup automagically generates the posts for the site from notebooks. Sweet! But it looks like this means the notebooks have to be git tracked. Have found in the past that tracking the <code>.ipynb</code> to be a pain (granted there are some tools to compare differences, would be nice if executing a notebook didn't specify git changes). I have found <a href="">jupytext</a> invaluable, allowing me to git track a paired <code>.py</code> script, for example, making it very clear what has changed in a notebook. Wondering if there may be a way to track files with paired jupytext scripts, while still allowing for the auto-generation of the posts.</li>
<li><strong>It's a big machine</strong>: The repo can be pretty intimidating. There are a lot of folders that make it go and a bunch of files with "THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT!" penciled in. Will take some getting used to, getting comfortable with the setup and knowing what parts I should touch. There are some files that I could burn myself on, so I will go slow, use oven mitts, and try not to void any warranties.</li>

<p>I'll keep <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#welcome-to-fastpages">the docs</a> handy.</p>
<p>Till next time!</p>
